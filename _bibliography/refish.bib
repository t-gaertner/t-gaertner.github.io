 XXXABSTRACT = {This paper brings together two strands of machine learning of increasing importance: kernel methods and highly structured data. We propose a general method for constructing a kernel following the syntactic structure of the data, as defined by its type signature in a higher-order logic. Our main theoretical result is the positive definiteness of any kernel thus defined. We report encouraging experimental results on a range of real-world data sets. By converting our kernel to a distance pseudo-metric for 1-nearest neighbour, we were able to improve the best accuracy from the literature on the Diterpene data set by more than 10{\XXX}.},

@ARTICLE{TG09b,
 XXXABSTRACT = {Support vector machine (SVM) database search strategies are presented that aim at the identification of small molecule ligands for targets for which no ligand information is currently available. In pharmaceutical research and chemical biology, this situation is faced, for example, when studying orphan targets or newly identified members of protein families. To investigate methods for de novo ligand identification in the absence of known three-dimensional target structures or active molecules, we have focused on combining sequence and ligand information for closely and distantly related proteins. To provide a basis for these investigations, a set of 11 protease targets from different families was assembled together with more than 2000 inhibitors directed against individual proteases. We have compared SVM approaches that combine protein sequence and ligand information in different ways and utilize 2D fingerprints as ligand descriptors. These methodologies were applied to search for inhibitors of individual proteases not taken into account during learning. A target sequence-ligand kernel and, in particular, a linear combination of multiple target-directed SVMs consistently identified inhibitors with high accuracy including test cases where homology-based similarity searching using data fusion and conventional SVM ranking nearly or completely failed. The SVM linear combination and target-ligand kernel methods described herein are intuitive and straightforward to adopt for ligand prediction against other targets.},

@ARTICLE{TG15,
  XXXABSTRACT = {A method is introduced for sequential similarity searching for active compounds. Given a set of known actives and a screening database, a strategy is devised to optimally rank test compounds by observing the outcome of each iteration before selecting the next compound. This `active search' approach is based upon Bayesian decision theory. A typical ranking procedure used in virtual compound screening corresponds to a myopic approximation to the optimal strategy. Exploratory active search represents a less-myopic approach and is shown to accurately identify a variety of active compounds in iterative virtual screening trials on 120 compound classes. Source code and data for the active search approach presented herein is made freely available.},
