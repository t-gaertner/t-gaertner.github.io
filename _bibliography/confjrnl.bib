  abstract = 	 {We investigate, theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of kernel K-means++ samples as landmarks in the Nyström method for low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. Previous empirical studies (Zhang et al., 2008; Kumar et al.,2012) observe that the landmarks obtained using (kernel) K-means clustering define a good low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. However, the existing work does not provide a theoretical guarantee on the approximation error for this approach to landmark selection. We close this gap and provide the first bound on the approximation error of the Nyström method with kernel K-means++ samples as landmarks. Moreover, for the frequently used Gaussian kernel we provide a theoretically sound motivation for performing Lloyd refinements of kernel K-means++ landmarks in the instance space. We substantiate our theoretical results empirically by comparing the approach to several state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract="We consider a semi-supervised learning scenario for regression, where only few labelled examples, many unlabelled instances and different data representations (multiple views) are available. For this setting, we extend support vector regression with a co-regularisation term and obtain co-regularised support vector regression (CoSVR). In addition to labelled data, co-regularisation includes information from unlabelled examples by ensuring that models trained on different views make similar predictions. Ligand affinity prediction is an important real-world problem that fits into this scenario. The characterisation of the strength of protein-ligand bonds is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery and design. We introduce variants of the base CoSVR algorithm and discuss their theoretical and computational properties. For the CoSVR function class we provide a theoretical bound on the Rademacher complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of CoSVR for the affinity prediction task and evaluate its performance empirically on different protein-ligand datasets. We show that CoSVR outperforms co-regularised least squares regression as well as existing state-of-the-art approaches for affinity prediction.
