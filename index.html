<h3><span dir="ltr" style="outline:none">Research Interests</span></h3>
<div style="text-align:left">My
 main research interests are efficient and effective machine learning 
and data mining algorithms. Machine learning considers the problem of 
extracting useful functional or probabilistic dependencies from a sample
 of data. Such dependencies can then, for instance, be used to predict 
properties of partially observed data. Data mining is often used in a 
broader sense and includes several different computational problems, for
 instance, finding regularities or patterns in data. By efficiency I mean
 on the one hand the classical computational complexity of decision, 
enumeration, etc. problems but on the other hand also a satisfactory 
response time that allows for effectiveness. By effectiveness I mean how
 well an algorithm helps to solve a real world problem. My recent focus is on challenges relevant to the <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztg/cml/"><b>constructive machine learning</b></a> setting where the task is to find domain instances with desired properties and the mapping between instances and their properties is only partially accessible. This includes <b>structured output prediction, active learning/search, online learning/optimisation, knowledge-based learning</b> and related areas. I am most interested in cases of this setting where at least one of the involved spaces is not a Euclidean space but for instance the set of graphs. My approach in many cases is based on <b>kernel methods</b> where I have focussed originally on <b>kernels for structured data</b>, moved to <b>semi-supervised / transductive learning</b>, and am currently looking at <b>parallel/distributed</b> approaches as well as <b>fast approximations</b>. The most recent knowledge-based kernel method was for instance focussing on <b>interactive visualisations for data exploration.</b> Application areas which I am often considering when looking for novel machine learning challenges are chemoinformatics and computer games.<br>

<h3>Curriculum Vitae - Highlights<br>
</h3>
Since October 2019 I am a Professor of Machine Learning at TU Wien. From July 2015 to September 2019 I was a 
Professor of Data Science at the University of Nottingham. Before that, I have been the head of a 
research group jointly hosted by the University of Bonn and the 
Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems 
IAIS. I hold a PhD
 from the 
University of Bonn ('05), a MSc from the University of Bristol ('00), 
and a Diplom ('99) as well as a degree as a certified engineering 
assistant ('98) from the University of Cooperative Education in 
Mannheim. I have been an editor of the Machine Learning journal (MLJ; <a href="http://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks/?search=machine+learning&amp;by=all&amp;source=ERA2010%0D%0A&amp;sort=atitle&amp;page=1" target="_blank">A*, top 7%</a>) for several years, served as a senior programme committee member for several international flagship conferences on machine learning and data mining (NIPS, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, ICML - all A*, top 4%), and reviewed for several funding agencies (ERC, DFG, EPSRC, BBSRC, ANR, ISF, FWO, NWO). In 2010 I received an award in the prestigious <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/index.html" target="_blank">Emmy Noether programme</a> of the German Research Foundation (DFG).<br>
