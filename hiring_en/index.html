To launch the research unit {{site.links.TUWienML_en}} at the {{site.links.TUWienInformatics}} we are looking to hire as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li><a href="#researcher">Researchers</a> (prae-doc and post-doc)</li>
<li><a href="#secretary">Secretary</a> (50%)</li>
<li><a href="#technician">Technician</a> (50%)</li>
<li><a href="#students">Students</a> </li>
</ul>
Vienna has repeatedly earned the title as the most liveable city in the world and the Computer Science Faculty at the TU Wien has consistently been ranked among the top 100 computer science departments in the world. Our group is strongly connected to the European and international machine learning scenes. Among other things, {{site.people.Thomas}} is an editor of the Machine Learning journal, was program co-chair of the largest European conference in the area (ECML PKDD'18), and has been area chair for NeurIPS for a number of years.<br><br>


<h3><a id="researcher"></a>Researchers</h3>
The research unit machine learning will investigate fundamental machine learning questions and demonstrate the applicability of novel algorithms in real-world application, often together with colleagues and collaborators from other disciplines such as Chemistry. Challenges that we investigate often involve structured data such as graphs, iterative learning processes such as online/active learning, approximation/convergence guarantees, and computational questions such as the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms. For an overview of some of my research interests, please have a look at my <a href="/papers">publications</a>.<br><br>
